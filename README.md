SportChimp is a single page application in angular12 that looks with material design just like an android app and communicates via http to the RestfulAPI that is build in django==3.2.10 to provide the user with data.

It provides the possibility to authenticate with a jwt token to an api endpoint that holds the userdata.

## General concept of the app

- This website aims to be the place for people, who want to exercise with others. 
- They can look for places and activities near them and take part. 
- This way the get to know new people with similar sporting interests and might find their new sporting buddy. 
- The app can be used by everyone who is interested in sport as we also plan to implement a feature which provides you with possible sporting activities near you so you can explore your cities offerings.
- A certain age group is not a target as sports can be performed by almost anyone, but we think our primary audience will be young adults to adults
(18-40 years).
