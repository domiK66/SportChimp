## General Info

This website aims to be the place for people, who want to exercise with others. They can look for places and activities near them and take part. This way the get to know new people with similar sporting interests and might find their new sporting buddy. The app can be used by everyone who is interested in sport as we also plan to implement a feature which provides you with possible sporting activities near you so you can explore your cities offerings. A certain age group is not a target as sports can be performed by almost anyone, but we think our primary audience will be young adults to adults
(18-40 years).
